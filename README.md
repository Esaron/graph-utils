# Graph Utils

This is a small graph utility with a few convenience methods for basic pathing
logic.

One could layer a domain-specific model on top of this, but I kept it generic.

I didn't have a lot of time to work on it, and don't anticipate having more any
time soon, so it's unlikely I'll be able to improve the areas I commented on.

## Running

1. Install Ruby
2. Run `./main.rb`

I would have set this up in Docker, but since "Install Ruby" is of roughly the
same level of effort as "Install Docker", I skipped it.
